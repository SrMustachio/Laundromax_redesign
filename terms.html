                    <h2>2. Laundry & Dry Cleaning Services</h2>
                    <p>We exercise the utmost care in processing articles entrusted to us and use such processes which, in our opinion, are best suited to the nature and condition of each individual article. However, we cannot assume responsibility for inherent weaknesses or defects in materials that are not readily apparent prior to processing.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pocket Checks:</strong> While we try to check pockets, it is the customer's responsibility to ensure all pockets are empty. We are not responsible for items left in pockets (pens, lipstick, gum, cash, jewelry) or any damage such items may cause to your clothes or our machines.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stains:</strong> We cannot guarantee the removal of all stains. Processing may sometimes make previously invisible stains visible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Separation:</strong> For Wash & Fold orders, we will wash all items together unless you provide specific separation instructions (e.g., separate whites). We are not responsible for color bleeding if items are not separated by the customer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                        <li><strong>Dry Cleaning:</strong> Liability for any specific Dry Cleaning item is limited to 10 times the cleaning cost of that item, regardless of the brand or condition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wear and Tear:</strong> We are not responsible for natural wear and tear, shrinkage, or damage to buttons, zippers, or sequins that occurs during the standard cleaning process.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Any claims for missing or damaged items must be reported within <strong>48 hours</strong> of delivery or pickup.</p>
